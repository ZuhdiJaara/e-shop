##Mini e-commerce project using a fake API

###I implemented the DummyJSON API using the "Alamofire" and "SwiftyJSON" libraries. I needed to use a few libraries, such as "Cosmos" to convert the rating from Double to Stars, the "SideMenu" library to create a side menu on the home page, and finally the "NVActivityIndicatorView" library to display the loader view when the data is loaded. All of these libraries were implemented using Cocoapods.
